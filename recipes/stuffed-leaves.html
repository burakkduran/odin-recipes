    <img src="../src/images/stuffed-leaves.jpeg" alt="Stuffed Leaves">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These grape leaves are stuffed with a tantalizing mixture of lemony rice and fresh herbs. "Yum" is the only word to describe them! Serve them as an appetizer, or as a main dish paired with crusty bread and a salad.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cups uncooked long-grain white rice</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped fresh dill</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped fresh mint leaves</li>
        <li>2 quarts chicken broth, divided</li>
        <li>¾ cup fresh lemon juice, divided</li>
        <li>60 fresh grape leaves</li>
        <li>1 cup olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add rice, onion, dill, and mint; sauté until onion is soft, about 5 minutes. Pour in 1/2 of the broth, reduce the heat to low, and simmer until rice is almost cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in 1/2 of the lemon juice and remove from the heat.</li>
        <li>Plunge grape leaves into a deep container of very hot water until soft, about 10 seconds; pat dry.</li>
        <li>Place a grape leaf onto a work surface with the shiny side facing down. Place 1 teaspoon rice mixture on leaf at the stem end; fold both sides in toward the center and roll up from the wide bottom to the top. Place stuffed leaf into a 4-quart pot. Repeat to stuff remaining leaves, packing them into the pot tightly so they don't open while cooking.</li>
        <li>Drizzle olive oil and remaining lemon juice over leaves, then pour in remaining broth to cover. Cover the pot and simmer for about 1 hour; do not let it boil as the stuffing may burst out of the leaves.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat, uncover, and let cool for 30 minutes. Transfer to a serving dish and serve.</li>
    </ol>
